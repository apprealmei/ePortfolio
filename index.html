        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Lives in Philippines, 20 years old, have learned to enjoy programming and developing software based on what I’ve learned throughout my studies. While I’m still learning, I’m proud of my ability to code and make simple websites. After finishing, I'm hoping to land a job in my field that I’ll be good at. I would describe myself as friendly, artsy, and fun, and cool. In my free time, I like to photograph, make art, play games and stroll, and I’m proud of the projects I’ve worked on in school. I'm looking forward to more learnings and experiences I'll have through this journey.</p>

            <p>The MIPS assembly language "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game primarily serves an educational purpose, demonstrating basic concepts such as user input handling, random number generation, conditional branching, and control flow. The program allows the user to play a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer. The game is a "best of three" format, meaning the first to win three rounds is the overall winner. Additionally, if the user loses a round, they are given a punishment, which is randomly selected as either a "Truth" or "Dare."</p>

            <p>This is an eCommerce UI design made in Figma, where salient attributes of the contemporary online shopping experience can be found. The design encompasses the offering of products, the shopping cart, movement of the user as well as a simple and fluid layout. The UI elements such as buttons, icons and banners were exported in PNG format and uploaded onto a GitHub repository. All of these assets are incorporated in a site, and are shown using the links, which makes it possible to have a more coherent and interactive flavor for the site’s shoppers.</p>

            <p>Laravel is a PHP web framework that is available as a free download that focuses on the development of contemporary web applications. It adheres to the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, and seeks to improve the development process and productivity of developers. Laravel has a number of features and components that are built-in such as routing, database migrations, authentication and an ORM (Eloquent) to work with the database. Its syntax is said to be elegant and simple to use with many supporters in the community. Laravel is just as often utilized for creating simple websites as well as large scale enterprise applications.</p>
